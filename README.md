# HackUMass-Hacking-RFID-Protocol

**HackUMass Fall 2022 Grand Prize Winner**

This repository contains all the code produced during the HackUMass 36-hour hackathon. Our project exposes insecurities in Wiegand, a commonly used RFID protocol, through reverse engineering and implementation. We demonstrate how a malicious adversary could jeopardize the security of the system, including remotely performing DoS (Denial of Service) and replay attacks on an access control system. 

To address these vulnerabilities, our project integrates a GUI for monitoring system status and the information passing through the system in real-time. Furthermore, we build upon our findings to implement a safer system that uses biometric 2-factor authentication to prevent replay attacks.

## Features

- **Security Analysis:** In-depth exploration of Wiegand protocol vulnerabilities.
- **GUI Integration:** Real-time monitoring of system status and data transmission.
- **Enhanced Security:** Implementation of a biometric 2-factor authentication system to mitigate replay attacks.
