# HackUMass-Hacking-RFID-Protocol

**HackUMass Fall 2022 Grand Prize Winner**

This repository contains all the code produced during the HackUMass 36-hour hackathon. Our project exposes vulnerabilities in Wiegand, a commonly used RFID protocol, through reverse engineering and implementation. We demonstrate how a malicious adversary could compromise the security of the system, including performing remote DoS (Denial of Service) and replay attacks on an access control system.

To address these vulnerabilities, our project integrates a GUI for real-time monitoring of system status and the information flowing through the system. Moreover, we build upon our findings to implement a more secure system that utilizes biometric 2-factor authentication to thwart replay attacks.

## Features

- **Security Analysis:** In-depth exploration of Wiegand protocol vulnerabilities.
- **GUI Integration:** Real-time monitoring of system status and data transmission.
- **Enhanced Security:** Implementation of a biometric 2-factor authentication system to mitigate replay attacks.
